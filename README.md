# Inverse Job Hunt Extension

ðŸš« Stop applying, start building! This Chrome extension is your intervention buddy that helps you focus on creating instead of endlessly applying to jobs that require 20 years of experience in a 5-year-old technology.

## What it Does
- Magically makes the Jobs tab disappear (because who needs more FOMO?)
- Intercepts those tempting Apply buttons before they lead you into another ATS black hole
- Serves you spicy reality checks disguised as LinkedIn-style popups
- Looks exactly like LinkedIn's UI (we're sneaky like that)

## Why You Need This
Are you:
- Filling out the same information for the 427th time this week?
- Writing cover letters that no one will ever read?
- Competing with 2,849 other applicants for a "urgent hiring" post from 2023?

Then this extension is your digital intervention! Instead of letting you apply, it'll remind you to work on that million-dollar idea you've been putting off.

## Installation

### Method 1: DIY Installation (for the tech-savvy rebels)
1. Clone/download this repo (yes, the green button that says "Code")
2. Extract the files (you know, the unzip thing)
3. Visit `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
4. Enable "Developer mode" (don't worry, we won't tell anyone)
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder (the one you just unzipped)

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store
Coming soonâ„¢ (just like those recruiter responses)

## How to Use
1. Install it (see above, if you haven't figured that out yet)
2. Visit LinkedIn
3. Notice the Jobs tab is gone (like your motivation to fill out another application)
4. Try clicking any Apply button (we dare you)
5. Enjoy your daily dose of reality checks and get back to building!

## Contributing
Got some spicy messages to add? Found a bug? Want to make it even more annoying? Here's how:

1. Fork it (not with a spoon)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/MakeItSpicier`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Added more sass'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/MakeItSpicier`)
5. Open a Pull Request (we promise to read it faster than recruiters read cover letters)

## License
MIT License - as free as those "entry-level" jobs requiring 10 years of experience! Use it however you want, we're not your HR department.
